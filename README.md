☕ **Motto:** Coffee first, then work.

## About Me
👋 Hi, I’m **Miya** — an advertising major turned full-stack developer & UI/UX designer who believes coffee and curiosity can solve almost anything.

🎨 From designing campaigns in Korea to designing interfaces in New Zealand, I’ve always loved understanding people and creating things they enjoy using.  
💻 I once thought code looked like alien language. Now I speak JavaScript, React, Node.js — and recently picked up TypeScript just for fun (and pain).  
📚 My projects mix creativity and logic — like a book, music, and movie logging site built from scratch with APIs, or a solar energy dashboard powered by thoughtful design (and too much coffee).  
🎮 Also designed a Māori language learning game — turns out, culture + UI = pretty cool.

🛠️ Currently exploring ways to make the web a little smarter, cleaner, and more human.
