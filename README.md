## About Me
👋 Hi, I’m **Miya** — an advertising major turned full-stack developer & UI/UX designer who believes coffee and curiosity can solve almost anything.

🎨 From designing campaigns in Korea to designing interfaces in New Zealand, I’ve always loved understanding people and creating things they enjoy using.  

💻 I once thought code looked like alien language. Now I speak JavaScript, React, Node.js — and recently picked up TypeScript just for fun (and pain).  

📚 My projects mix creativity and logic — like a book, music, and movie logging site built from scratch with APIs, or a solar energy dashboard powered by thoughtful design (and too much coffee).  

🎮 Also designed a Māori language learning game — turns out, culture + UI = pretty cool.

🛠️ Currently exploring ways to make the web a little smarter, cleaner, and more human.

## Technical Skills

### 💡 UI/UX Design

- **Tool:** Figma (proficient)  
- **Projects:** Kupukupu · Te Kēmu Arapū · Solar Energy Dashboard

I use Figma to turn ideas into interactive, user-centered digital experiences. Across all three projects, I followed a full UI/UX design process and focused on solving real user problems through clear, accessible, and engaging interfaces.

#### 🧭 My UI/UX Process:
- **User Research** – Understand goals and pain points through stakeholder input and competitor analysis.  
- **Persona & Scenario Building** – Define user types, needs, and use cases.  
- **Information Architecture** – Organize content logically for smoother navigation.  
- **User Flow & Task Flow** – Map how users move and interact step-by-step.  
- **Wireframing** – Sketch low-fidelity layouts for structure and testing.  
- **High-Fidelity Design** – Create detailed, clickable prototypes with clean UI and consistent visual style.  
- **Usability Testing** – Gather feedback, improve designs, and make the experience better for users.

I enjoy blending design thinking with empathy and structure—making sure users not only understand how to use a product, but enjoy using it.

### 💻 Web Development

- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript (beginner), currently learning Vue and D3.js  
- **Application:**  
  - Built full-stack web applications like **Connect It**, a personal media tracking platform with API integration (Google Books, Spotify, TMDB), responsive layouts, and interactive blog features.  
  - Developed a **blogging system** with full authentication, dynamic content, and user-friendly design.  
  - Designed the **Solar Energy Dashboard**, a front-end project focused on real-time energy data visualization—currently using it to explore and learn **D3.js**.

I enjoy making web apps that not only work well, but look and feel good too—clean, responsive, and built with users in mind.

### 🧠 Software Development

- **Technologies:** Proficient in Java, experienced with Python  
- **Application:**  
  - Developed a **comprehensive inventory management system** using Java as a final project in the *Programming for Industry* course. This involved building backend logic and connecting it with a functional front-end interface to simulate real-world business operations.  
  - Used **Python** for **GIS automation**, streamlining spatial data tasks and improving processing efficiency—demonstrating my ability to write practical scripts for data manipulation and automation.

I enjoy solving problems with clean, logical code—whether it's organizing inventory or automating maps.

### 🗄️ Database Management

- **Technologies:** SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Sequelize (ORM)  
- **Application:**  
  - Designed and managed relational database schemas using **MariaDB** for a blogging platform with user authentication and content management.  
  - Built a structured **MySQL** database for **Connect It**, integrating with **Sequelize** to simplify queries and improve maintainability in a full-stack React + Node.js application.

I focus on writing clean, scalable database structures that keep apps fast, flexible, and easy to maintain.

### 📊 Data Visualization

- **Technologies:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Figma, currently learning D3.js  
- **Application:**  
  - Designed and built the **Solar Energy Dashboard**, focusing on clear data flow and front-end visualization to present energy generation and usage in an intuitive way.  
  - Applied UI/UX principles to turn complex data into **engaging, user-friendly visuals**, improving user understanding and decision-making.

I love making data not just informative, but beautiful and easy to grasp.


## ✨ About Me (Beyond the Code)

## 💛 Obsessions

### ☕ Coffee
As a self-confessed coffee addict, my day is powered by everything from espressos to Americanos, short blacks to long blacks—I savor every unadulterated sip.  
**Motto:** “Coffee first, then conquer.”

### 🎵 Music
If I had to choose just one sense to keep, it would undoubtedly be hearing—because I can’t imagine life without music. Whether I’m driving, working, or hitting the gym, music is my constant companion, boosting both efficiency and joy.  
That’s why I’m never without my headphones—always ready to dive into a soundtrack for life.

### ✈️ Travel  
I thrive on spontaneous trips—the kind where an idea sparks and I just hit the road. Especially when plans align with friends, there’s magic in the chaos of dividing tasks and heading off together.  
For me, travel isn’t about checking boxes—it’s about freedom, surprises, and the real joy found on the journey.

### 💭 Daydreaming  
I cherish my daydreaming moments—times when I escape into my own thoughts.  
Sometimes I replay past events and wonder “what if?”  
Sometimes I reflect and improve.  
Other times I plan future adventures like rehearsing in a parallel universe.  
Daydreaming isn’t just wandering—it’s how I strategize, stay curious, and grow.
